# Roadmapper
An easy way to begin creating a digital product roadmap.
## How to use
* On the back of a napkin at a bar or restaurant!
* As a print-out during facilitated ideation sessions with executive leadership!
* On a whiteboard while ideating with your cross-functional peers!
## Printouts
* [Pdf](https://github.com/patrickbrandt/roadmapper/blob/master/Roadmapper.pdf)
* [PowerPoint](https://github.com/patrickbrandt/roadmapper/blob/master/Roadmapper.pptx)
  * you can keep it digital with the PowerPoint: data can be entered directly into the file (*I don't recommend this)
